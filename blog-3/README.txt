This is a modified version of geograpy2, modified to work and to recognize either only countries or all nouns in general (except pronouns).The results will be in output_new file as text and in cvs format with the counts of each word in output_final . 
I also wrote a TechCrunch scraper. 
To use, do python placecontext.py (category) (country or noun)
for example, if I put blog-3 folder in desktop and wanted to find articles on artificial-intelligence, I would call: \
python placecontext.py artificial-intelligence nouns
