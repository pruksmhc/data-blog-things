his is a modified version of geograpy2, modified to work and to recognize only countries. \
I also wrote a TechCrunch scraper. 
To use, do python placecontext.py (category) (your directory up to the blog-3 folder) \
for example, if I put blog-3 folder in desktop and wanted to find articles on artificial-intelligence, I would call: \
python placecontext.py artificial-intelligence /Users/\'85../desktop
